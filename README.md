Brevet time calculator with AJAX and MongoDB!

## Overview

This code does NOT work at the moment.

This code should open a website that will calculate the brevet times for 
certain control distance races. There are a lot of rules for calculating thses
brevet times that are coded into this. 

this also should have a submit and display button, where the submit button will
put the brevet distances, open times, and close times in a Mongo database.
 Which display will use to show the brevet distances and times. (THIS DOES
NOT WORK AT THE MOMENT)


## note

I basically wasn't able to get anything to work becasue I started too late and
was unable to finish in time when I kept facing issues with testium and my 
docker-compose. I am very sorry and will remedy these errors to the best of 
my ability at the soonest time possible.

I have a submit and display button, but things either break when they are pushed
or other weird things happen, not what is supposed to happen. 

I think it should build thoough for what its worth
